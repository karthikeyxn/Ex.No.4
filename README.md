### REGISTER NUMBER :212223040088 
### Aim:

To design and evaluate the effectiveness of various Prompt Engineering techniques—including Comparative Analysis, Experiential Perspective, Everyday Functioning, Universal Prompt Structures, and Prompt Refinements with Size Limitations—in improving AI output quality and contextual adaptability.

1. Comparative Analysis Prompt
### Explanation:

A Comparative Analysis Prompt asks the model to analyze, compare, or contrast two or more subjects. It helps generate balanced and objective evaluations.

Generated Prompt:

“Compare and contrast online learning and traditional classroom learning in terms of accessibility, cost, and student engagement.”

### Procedure:

Define two entities to compare.

Mention specific parameters or dimensions of comparison.

Request a tabular or paragraph-based output.

### Evaluation / Result:
| Factor             | Online Learning                         | Traditional Learning                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Accessibility      | High – can be accessed globally         | Limited – requires physical presence             |
| Cost               | Generally cheaper                       | Often more expensive                             |
| Student Engagement | Varies based on platform and discipline | Typically higher due to face-to-face interaction |

### Conclusion:

Comparative Analysis Prompts encourage structured, balanced, and multi-dimensional reasoning, making them ideal for analytical reports, academic writing, and evaluations.

2. Experiential Perspective Prompt
### Explanation:

This prompt type makes the AI respond from a personal or human-like experiential viewpoint, creating a relatable and emotional connection in the response.

Generated Prompt:

“Describe your experience as a student adapting to online classes during the pandemic.”

### Procedure:

Ask the model to assume a role or perspective.

Frame the prompt using experience-driven or emotional language.

Evaluate coherence, tone, and realism in the response.

### Evaluation / Result:

“As a student during the pandemic, adapting to online classes was initially overwhelming. I missed personal interactions, but gradually I found comfort in flexible schedules and recorded sessions. The experience taught me self-discipline and adaptability.”

### Conclusion:

Experiential Perspective Prompts produce empathetic, narrative-style responses useful for storytelling, psychology, and design thinking contexts.

3. Everyday Functioning Prompt
### Explanation:

These prompts simulate daily life tasks or problem-solving situations. They test how effectively the AI handles real-world, routine queries.

Generated Prompt:

“Plan a healthy 5-day vegetarian meal schedule with easy recipes for a college student on a budget.”

### Procedure:

Pose a realistic, practical situation.

Include clear constraints (e.g., budget, time).

Observe the AI’s ability to create applicable, feasible responses.

### Evaluation / Result:

Day 1: Oats breakfast, vegetable pulao lunch, lentil soup dinner.

Day 2: Smoothie bowl, chickpea salad, vegetable curry with rice.

(…continues similarly for 5 days)

### Conclusion:

Everyday Functioning Prompts are valuable for contextual learning and applied reasoning, improving task-oriented response accuracy.

4. Universal Prompt Structures
### Explanation:

Universal prompts are versatile, reusable templates that can be applied across various topics. They establish a consistent pattern for question framing and AI interpretation.

Generated Prompt Template:

“Explain [concept/topic] in simple terms, provide one example, and discuss its real-world application.”

### Procedure:

Identify a reusable structure.

Substitute the main topic dynamically.

Measure consistency and clarity of results across subjects.

Example Used:
“Explain photosynthesis in simple terms, provide one example, and discuss its real-world application.”

### Evaluation / Result:

Photosynthesis is how plants convert sunlight into food. For example, green leaves use sunlight and carbon dioxide to make glucose. This process supports oxygen production essential for life on Earth.

### Conclusion:

Universal prompt structures enhance reusability and clarity, ensuring scalable and predictable AI interactions.

5. Prompt Refinements & Size Limitations
### Explanation:

This concept involves adjusting prompt length, wording, or scope to balance precision and detail. Long prompts add context; short ones improve focus.

Generated Prompts:

Long Version: “Explain how artificial intelligence can transform the healthcare industry, focusing on diagnostics, patient management, and cost reduction.”

Refined Short Version: “How does AI improve healthcare efficiency?”

### Procedure:

Start with an extended prompt.

Gradually refine it by removing redundancy.

Compare quality, relevance, and coherence of outputs.

### Evaluation / Result:

Long Prompt Output: Detailed explanation across multiple aspects (diagnostics, cost, patient care).

Short Prompt Output: Concise and focused summary of efficiency aspects.

### Conclusion:

Prompt refinement is essential for context control and token efficiency. Balancing prompt size ensures both completeness and model responsiveness.

### Overall Conclusion:
| Prompt Type                | Strength               | Ideal Use Case                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Comparative Analysis       | Analytical depth       | Research, evaluation tasks              |
| Experiential Perspective   | Empathy and realism    | Storytelling, design, user experience   |
| Everyday Functioning       | Practical reasoning    | Daily task simulation                   |
| Universal Prompt Structure | Reusability            | Consistent query frameworks             |
| Prompt Refinements         | Precision & efficiency | Long-form or token-limited interactions |
